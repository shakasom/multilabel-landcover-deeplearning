# Multi-label Land Cover Classification with Deep Learning


Multi-label land cover classification is less explored compared to single-label classifications. In contrast, multi-label classifications are more realistic as we always find out multiple land cover in each image. However, with the Deep learning applications and Convolutional Neural Networks, we can tackle the challenge of multilabel classifications.


In this tutorial, we use the redesigned Multi-label UC Merced dataset with 17 land cover classes. UC Merced Land use dataset was initially introduced as one of the earliest satellite datasets for computer vision. The UC Merced dataset is considered as the MNIST of satellite image dataset. The original dataset consisted of 21 classes of single-label classification.
